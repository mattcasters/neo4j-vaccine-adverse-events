Additional details were reported as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of erythema multiforme (EM) in a female patient aged 2-year-old who was vaccinated with unspecified influenza vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis. This case corresponds to result section reported in this literature article. The patient was a part of study that aimed to describe reported Erythema multiforme, Stevens Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (EM/SJS/TEN) after vaccines during 1st October 1999 through 31st December 2017 (among reports received by CDC and FDA through April 27, 2018). Country reports of EM/SJS/TEN received by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) were identified and compared the relative frequency of EM/SJS/TEN reported to VAERS by vaccine, to better understand if there were any concerning patterns of reported EM/SJS/TEN (e.g., after a specific vaccine, or among a particular age group) or other emerging safety concerns. [In this study, it was reported AEs occurring after vaccination can be reported to VAERS, a national spontaneous reporting system established in 1990 to monitor AEs that is jointly administered by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]. No information on patient's medical or family history or concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided. On an unspecified date, the patient received unspecified influenza vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided.  On an unspecified date, an unknown period after vaccination, the patient was noted with EM. On an unspecified date between 1st October 1999 through 31st December 2017 (among reports received by CDC and FDA through 27th April 2018), the patient received unspecified influenza vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided. On an unspecified date between 1st October 1999 through 31st December 2017 (received as of 27th April 2018), an unknown period after vaccination, the patient was again noted with EM. [In this study, the resulting reports for reports of EM/SJS/TEN that were diagnosed by physicians (reported by a physician, or a physician's diagnosis was documented in available medical records) were received. For reports of symptoms consistent with EM/SJS/TEN, but without a physician's diagnosis, we defined EM as papular lesions, classically with a ringed (‘‘targetoid"") appearance, usually beginning peripherally and then spreading to the torso, that could involve the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet, without mucosal lesions. Most reports of EM/SJS/TEN described onset of symptoms within 14 days of vaccination] Treatment was unknown. Outcome of the event was not reported. The authors commented, ""Of the 4 persons we describe who previously experienced EM or SJS after vaccination, two experienced another episode of EM or SJS after the same vaccine (positive rechallenge). Our estimated reporting rates of EM/SJS/TEN after varicella and influenza vaccines were well below this figure (i.e., the highest estimate was 1.0 report of EM per million doses of varicella vaccine distributed), a notable observation considering that varicella vaccine was one of the most commonly reported vaccines after which EM/SJS/TEN occurred. Despite potentially underestimating rates, our data suggest that EM/SJS/TEN is reported no more frequently after vaccination than after known causes of these conditions. Importantly, while EM/SJS/TEN can occur after vaccination, previous post-marketing analyses and case-control studies demonstrate that vaccination itself does not increase the likelihood of these conditions"". The authors concluded ""EM/SJS/TEN were rarely reported after vaccination; data mining identified a known association between EM and smallpox vaccine"".

As a direct and proximate result of the Company's defective zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) vaccine, the patient's symptoms have resulted in physical limitations not present prior to using the Company's product. The patient also experienced mental and emotional distress due to resulting physical limitations and seriousness of the patient's condition. As a result of the manufacture, marketing, advertising, promotion, distribution and/or sale of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX), the patient sustained severe and permanent personal injuries. Further, as a tragic consequence of the Company's wrongful conduct, the patient suffered serious, progressive, permanent, and incurable injuries, as well as significant conscious pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, physical impairment and injury. As a direct and proximate result of the Company's conduct, the patient has suffered and incurred damages, including medical expenses; the loss of accumulations; and other economic and non-economic damages. The outcome of the events was not recovered. The causality was related.

855509,1/6/2020,IN,,,,M,,"Cold antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia; This is a literature report from the Clinical Case Reports. This is the first reported case of cold antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia due to anti-Pr autoantibodies attributed to Pneumococcal vaccination in an adult patient. The patient presented 1 week after receiving the vaccination with low hemoglobin, jaundice, and dyspnea with no prior history of anemia. Extensive workup including ruling out infectious and malignant causes was unremarkable, and his treatment consisted of transfusions and a course of steroids. An autoantibody anti-Pr was identified with persistence but decreased reactivity up to 3 months after his initial presentation.  The patient is a 72-year-old man who presented with jaundice and increasing dyspnea on exertion and was found to be anemic with hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL. His symptoms began approximately 1 week after receiving the pneumococcal 13-val conj vac (dipht crm197 protein) (PREVNAR 13) vaccination. The patient had been in stable health with a documented hemoglobin level of 13.9 g/dL at the time of his implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement 2 months prior. His past medical history included congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 10%, type II diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. His medication regimen had been stable for several years and included low strength aspirin, naproxen, lisinopril, carvedilol, furosemide, potassium chloride, simvastatin, metformin, glipizide, gabapentin, omeprazole, docusate sodium, folic acid, and a daily multivitamin. He had no prior history of anemia and had never before required a blood transfusion. At presentation, the patient was jaundiced with stable vital signs (temperature of 98.8 degree F, heart rate of 88 beats/minute, blood pressure of 112/61 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air). Laboratory results were significant for a low RBC count (2.60 M/CUMM; normal range: 4.15-5.75 M/ CUMM), reticulocyte count of 0.5 percent, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; 445 U/L; normal range 125-243 U/L), decreased haptoglobin (<8 mg/dL; normal range 30-200 mg/ dL), and elevated total bilirubin (5.2 mg/dL; normal level up to 1.2 mg/dL). A peripheral blood smear was remarkable for spherocytosis. Direct antiglobulin testing was negative on two separate occasions for IgG as well as complement C3 components. A cold autoantibody was identified that reacted to all panel cells. The antibody was nonreactive with enzyme-treated RBCs and identified as anti-Pr The patient was diagnosed with cold antibody AIHA most likely secondary to recent administration of the pneumococcal vaccination (PREVNAR 13). Further workup was unremarkable including the following: hepatitis serology testing, serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation, general flow cytometry screening, Cryoglobulin testing, iron studies, folate, and B12. Parvovirus showed positive IgG and negative IgM, consistent with prior infection. Polymerase chain reaction testing for Parvovirus was negative. Computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis demonstrated several borderline mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 1.3 cm, a left implantable cardioverter- defibrillator (ICD) in place, a moderately enlarged heart, no obvious lung abnormalities or nodules, and a normal appearing liver and spleen with no abdominal or pelvic lymphadenopathy. He had a white blood cell count of 3.5 K/ CUMM (normal range 3.3-10.5 K/CUMM) and platelet count of 215 K/CUMM (normal range 150-400 K/CUMM). During his hospitalization, the patient's hemoglobin dropped to 6.6 g/dL, and his bilirubin increased to 6.6 mg/ dL with a normal direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL. The patient was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells and discharged home in stable condition with a post-transfusion hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL. At follow-up, 11 days after his transfusion, his hemoglobin had dropped to 6.8 g/dL. He received two additional units of packed red blood cells with rise in hemoglobin to 9.3 g/dL. The patient was also treated with a course of prednisone with taper over 2 months. His hemoglobin level continued to rise, reaching 13.8 g/dL 3 months after discontinuation of steroid treatment. A blood sample at that time showed persistence of anti-Pr, though with overall decreased reactivity strengths. The patient's laboratory studies showed no evidence of hemolysis with a normal LDH of 187 U/L and RBC of 4.61 M/CUMM. Information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender's Comments: Based on the information currently available (hemolytic anemia occurred one week post vaccination with Prevnar 13 and positive cold autoantibody identified against Pr antigen the antigenic determinants of which have been found on almost all RBCs), it cannot be excluded that Pneumococcal vaccination with Prevnar 13 may elicit the formation of Pr specific autoantibody thus triggered the occurrence of cold antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

The following is verbatim from the article:  Background: Since the last review of vaccine safety surveillance data for erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), SJS/TEN, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (EM/SJS/TEN), over 37 new vaccines have been introduced. We sought to describe reported EM/SJS/TEN after vaccines during 1999-2017.  Methods: We identified reports of EM/SJS/TEN received by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 1999-2017. We stratified analysis by condition (EM, SJS, or TEN), and analyzed reports by serious or non-serious status, sex, age group, time from vaccination to symptom onset, exposure to known causes of EM/SJS/TEN, and vaccines administered. We used Empirical Bayesian data mining to detect vaccine-AE pairs reported more frequently than expected. Results: Of 466,027 reports to VAERS during 1999-017, we identified 984 reports of EM, 89 reports of SJS, 6 reports of SJS/TEN, and 7 reports of TEN. Few reports of EM (9%), and most reports of SJS (52%), SJS/TEN (100%), and TEN (100%) were serious. Overall, 55% of reports described males, 48% described children aged 4 years; 58% of EM/SJS/TEN occurred 7 days after vaccination. Few reports (5%) described exposure to known causes of EM/SJS/TEN. Overall, childhood vaccines (e.g., combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine) were most commonly reported. We identified 6 deaths; 4 were exposed to medications associated with EM/SJS/TEN. EM after smallpox vaccine was reported disproportionately among people aged 19 - 49 years.  Conclusions: EM/SJS/TEN were rarely reported after vaccination; data mining identified a known association between EM and smallpox vaccine.  This case involves a 43 years old female patient who experienced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), respiratory failure (respiratory failure) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (toxic epidermal necrolysis) while she received vaccine INFLUENZA VACCINE.

855683,1/7/2020,,,,,F,,"Erythema multiforme; Initial information received on 31-Dec-2019 regarding an unsolicited valid serious case from other healthcare professional issued from a literature article.   This case is linked to cases 2020SA001262, 2020SA001250, 2020SA001235 and 2020SA001256 (same reporter).  Abstract:  Since the last review of vaccine safety surveillance data for erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), SJS/TEN, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (EM/SJS/TEN), over 37 new vaccines have been introduced. We sought to describe reported EM/SJS/TEN after vaccines during 1999-2017. Methods: We identified reports of EM/SJS/TEN received by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 1999-2017. We stratified analysis by condition (EM, SJS, or TEN), and analyzed reports by serious or non-serious status, sex, age group, time from vaccination to symptom onset, exposure to known causes of EM/SJS/TEN, and vaccines administered. We used data mining to detect vaccine-AE pairs reported more frequently than expected. Results: Of 466,027 reports to VAERS during 1999-017, we identified 984 reports of EM, 89 reports of SJS, 6 reports of SJS/TEN, and 7 reports of TEN. Few reports of EM (9%), and most reports of SJS (52%), SJS/TEN (100%), and TEN (100%) were serious. Overall, 55% of reports described males, 48% described children aged 4 years; 58% of EM/SJS/TEN occurred 7 days after vaccination. Few reports (5%) described exposure to known causes of EM/SJS/TEN. Overall, childhood vaccines (e.g., combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine) were most commonly reported. We identified 6 deaths; 4 were exposed to medications associated with EM/SJS/TEN. EM after smallpox vaccine was reported disproportionately among people aged 19 - 49 years. Conclusions: EM/SJS/TEN were rarely reported after vaccination; data mining identified a known association between EM and smallpox vaccine.  This case involves a 2 years old female patient who experienced erythema multiforme (erythema multiforme), while she received vaccine INFLUENZA VACCINE.  Medical history, medical treatment(s), vaccination(s) and family history were not provided.   On an unknown date, the patient received a dose of suspect INFLUENZA VACCINE produced by unknown manufacturer (lot number not reported) via unknown route in unknown administration site.  On an unknown date, the patient developed a serious erythema multiforme (erythema multiforme) (Unknown latency) following the administration of INFLUENZA VACCINE. This event was assessed as medically significant.  Laboratory details were not reported.  Final diagnosis was erythema multiforme.   It was not reported if the patient received a corrective treatment.  The outcome of the event was not reported.  There will be no information available on the batch number for this case.; Sender's Comments: This case concerns a two years old female patient who presented with erythema multiforme (EM) following the vaccination with INFLUENZA VACCINE (unknown manufacturer). The time to onset is unknown. The patient's past medical history, concomitant medication, lab data ruling out alternate etiologies would be needed for complete assessment. Based upon the reported information, the role the vaccine cannot be assessed.",,,,,,,,,U,,,,,UNK,,,,,,USSA2020SA001225,2,1/7/2020,,,,

This case is linked to cases 2020SA001262, 2020SA001225, 2020SA001235 and 2020SA001256 (same reporter).  Abstract:  Since the last review of vaccine safety surveillance data for erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), SJS/TEN, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (EM/SJS/TEN), over 37 new vaccines have been introduced. We sought to describe reported EM/SJS/TEN after vaccines during 1999-2017. Methods: We identified reports of EM/SJS/TEN received by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 1999-2017. We stratified analysis by condition (EM, SJS, or TEN), and analyzed reports by serious or non-serious status, sex, age group, time from vaccination to symptom onset, exposure to known causes of EM/SJS/TEN, and vaccines administered. We used data mining to detect vaccine-AE pairs reported more frequently than expected. Results: Of 466,027 reports to VAERS during 1999-017, we identified 984 reports of EM, 89 reports of SJS, 6 reports of SJS/TEN, and 7 reports of TEN. Few reports of EM (9%), and most reports of SJS (52%), SJS/TEN (100%), and TEN (100%) were serious. Overall, 55% of reports described males, 48% described children aged 4 years; 58% of EM/SJS/TEN occurred 7 days after vaccination. Few reports (5%) described exposure to known causes of EM/SJS/TEN. Overall, childhood vaccines (e.g., combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine) were most commonly reported. We identified 6 deaths; 4 were exposed to medications associated with EM/SJS/TEN. EM after smallpox vaccine was reported disproportionately among people aged 19 - 49 years. Conclusions: EM/SJS/TEN were rarely reported after vaccination; data mining identified a known association between EM and smallpox vaccine.  This case involves a 78 years old male patient who experienced erythema multiforme (EM) (erythema multiforme), while he received vaccine INFLUENZA VACCINE (TRIVALENT).  Medical history, medical treatment(s), vaccination(s) and family history were not provided. The patient was undergoing radiation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer.  Concomitant medications included phenytoin for 2 months prior to developing EM.  On an unknown date, the patient received a dose of suspect INFLUENZA VACCINE (TRIVALENT) produced by unknown manufacturer (lot number not reported) via unknown route in unknown administration site.  On an unknown date, the patient developed a serious erythema multiforme (erythema multiforme) four days following the administration of INFLUENZA VACCINE (TRIVALENT). This event was assessed as medically significant.  Laboratory details were not reported.  Final diagnosis was erythema multiforme.   It was not reported if the patient received a corrective treatment.  The patient outcome was not reported.  The reporter suggest that EM (erythema multiforme) rarely occur after vaccination  There will be no information available on the batch number for this case.; Sender's Comments: This case concerns a 78 years old male patient who presented with erythema multiforme (EM) four days following the vaccination with INFLUENZA VACCINE (TRIVALENT) (unknown manufacturer). The time to onset is compatible. The patient had been taking phenytoin for 2 months prior to developing EM. He had small cell lung cancer and was receiving radiation therapy.

Summary of my conditions, starting after my second immunization of shingles on 8/7/19.   Before the immunization: My physical condition was excellent. I was a very active person, able to work and do any activity if needed for more than twelve hours a day. I would easily walk five miles or more a day. I took five intense exercise classes a week . Also, I would go to very active and strenuous folk-dancing one or two evenings a week for three hours at the time.  After the second immunization: After the immunization I had  very limited  energy  as well as other numerous problems. ** After the immunization all my muscles became extremely weak, I had to stay in bed for four days. I have been a basket case for the past five months. *My trainer 8/13/19  saw me; he defined my condition ?As if a truck had hit me.?   The first episode  started 10 minutes into my training session with my trainer, suddenly all my muscles collapsed during the training session. Then my left knee muscles weakened, simply by getting up from a chair my knee twisted. I was in terrible pain, I could barely walk. Had to lay down until I could go home. It took a month and a half for the pain to end. *As a result of my muscles weakening, also my back gave out. Thus, I required an MRI which revealed a new herniated disk (L3 and L4) see MRI (10/14/19)). The supposition was that the new herniated disk was a result of the muscle collapse caused by the Shingrix vaccine. *Afterword?s, I had pain when sitting and could not sit for more than 10 minutes;  this lasted for one week. Then the pain stopped. *Then I could not even walk for more than 100 ft., I was in terrible pain; lasting  for 3 weeks. Then the walking pain ended  because of my trainer: *My trainer was successful in stopping my back pain and the inability to walk by strengthening my back muscles. I also used medication for week. (see below).  * In addition, I could hardly get up from any sitting position for more than four months. Finally, after nearly five months (12/29/19) and training. I now can get up with less difficulties  from a seated position.  * In addition: After the immunization I had the following reactions and symptoms which affected me in a cyclical manner, moving from one part to another part of my body, deteriorating different parts of my body to different degrees. At times, the affected part got better, in some cases it?s still not back to normal, and other parts  of my body got worse. Unfortunately, as of today 1/8/2020, I  have not yet returned to NORMAL. A  simple walk to do shopping resulted in the following: after an hour, I had to cut it short since I felt tired and my hands got very cold, even though the rest of my body was overheated because I was dressed very warmly.  *My face color sometimes looks ?ashen?. Then it looks more normal; but as my strength diminishes, I become pale again. * For the past five months, this has prevented me from working or performing other strenuous activity. All this started after the immunization which has impacted me very dramatically. *I slept  excessively, from 11 to 16 hours a day, until the end of November. * I presently I sleep about 8 hours a day.  * But I must take many rest periods during  the day, every half hour or so. Sometimes I spend the whole day in bed. However, I still feel tired even though I need less sleep. *I have a very limited energy level and get tired very quickly. If I do simple ?housework? like washing dishes or putting things away or walking from 15 to 30 minutes, I have to rest for at least an hour. Also, if I stayed out of bed in the morning, or went out, or straightened up my home, then I had to sleep in the afternoon from 3 to 5 hours. In the evening, I would get  up for an hour or so; then back to sleep all night. As of now, 1/8/20, there has been improvement as stated above. *As of 11/15/19 my stamina was slightly improved and I started exercises. Thus, I increased the amount of work or physical exertion from half an hour to an hour doing work around the house. (See below examples.) * I get VERY COLD just sitting around or sleeping. But it gets worse if I exercise. (See below exercise.) * I lost about 10 pounds of weight since 8/7/19. Since 12/22/19 my appetite is nearly back to normal.  EXERCISE: From 11/15/19 to 12/26/19. Since 12/26/19 NO EXERCISE. *I started doing very minimal exercise for maximum of half an hour exercises three times a week.  *If I take an exercise class, or other activities which require physical effort, my body, instead acting normally to get hot and sweaty, I sometimes get VERY COLD. While walking, exercising or even sleeping, sometimes  my hands and feet get freezing and mybody gets cold. Nearly every night I have to sleep with warm socks. My condition has gotten a bit better since 12/10/19. I do feel a bit warmer and develop cold spells less often, although cold spells still occur several times a day. *I started exercising  again. The exercise had a bad effect on me: I felt dizzy twice, when walking my legs became very heavy, and I have difficulties climbing stairs. The trainer told me to immediately stop all exercise as of 12/26/19.  Therefore, I stopped even the limited exercise. * Trainer told me, ?that I am not ready to exercise, because my spine muscles need to be further strengthened, otherwise I would get a spinal injury.? He recommends only the following exercise for me right now : (A) walking and (B) swimming for a short time.  * I had to stop exercising. This is another reversal of my getting back to normal.",,,,,,,,Y,N,8/7/2019,8/7/2019,0,"A) Trainer (8/13/19) visit: Technique specialist; trainer knows my physical muscle condition for past 20 years; Personal education master in training. Knew my healthy condition prior to the immunization. While he was training me, witnessed on 8/13/19 the sudden collapse of my muscles throughout my body. As a result of my muscle weakness, my knee went out. I had to lay on the couch and the pain and discomfort in my knee, as well as the weakness, lasted for more than a month. In addition to weakness in walking and climbing stairs, I was also unable to drive my standard shift car for that month. My trainer was successful in stopping my back pain and inability to walk for a month by strengthening my collapsed back muscles.  Recommendation and Action:  That I am not ready to exercise or to do an extended amount of other physical exertion, since my spine muscles need to strengthen, otherwise I can get a spinal injury. Thus, presently, I am not allowed to do even minimal exercise or other physical exertion, until I can strengthen my back muscles.

Recommendation and Action: She took an additional 30 blood tests. I have a scheduled follow up visit in 1/16/20: to discuss my blood test results and what additional steps have to be taken to find a solution to my conditions. (3) (9/16/19) Neurologist specializing in neuro-muscular disorders.   Was examined twice and took all necessary blood tests. All tests were negative. The third time I rushed to see him before the weekend because my breathing felt very labored and I was concerned that perhaps my lung muscles were failing. Fortunately, this episode lasted only an hour  and resolved itself. Recommendation and Action: Dr. told me I am healthy that I will be OK. (4) Immunologist and Allergist (10/3/2019;10/28/19 and 12/5/2019)  Was examined and  took all necessary blood tests. All tests were negative.

Initial physical examination was remarkable for diminished motor strength in upper (3/5) and lower extremities (2/5) accompanied by areflexia. During hospitalization his condition worsened with subsequent development of ataxia as well as generalized weakness. Thirty-six hours after the admission, the patient developed respiratory muscle weakness with worsening negative inspiratory force (NIF) and subsequent hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation. Laboratory evaluation was unremarkable and head computed tomography (CT) scan did not suggest acute intracranial event. Further studies, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, failed to reveal albuminocytologic dissociation or any acute infectious process. An electromyography to evaluate for polyneuropathy revealed delayed distal latencies, decreased velocity, and absent F waves suggestive of an acute demyelinating polyneuropathy. The patient was diagnosed to Guillain-Barre syndrome. Despite receiving intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) for 5 days the patient was a failure to wean from mechanical ventilation and a tracheostomy was performed, along with a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy due to dysphagia. As a result, two additional courses of IVIGs and one course of plasmapheresis were administered which led to weaning of mechanical ventilation and improvement of motor function. The patient was discharged on physical rehabilitation. This case has been considered as serious due to hospitalization. The author commented, ""The influenza vaccine is recommended annually for every patient older than 6 months. Reported side effects include soreness on injection site, nausea, headache, fever, myalgia, and rarely, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). GBS is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis, with annual incidence of 1.2-3 cases per 100,000 habitants. Even though there is low risk for the development of GBS, it is important to recognize that, annually, one to two cases of GBS are reported per million of patients vaccinated with influenza. The only risk factor identified was the administration of influenza vaccination two weeks prior to admission. GBS is recognized as an acute immune-mediated polyneuropathy, usually provoked by a preceding infection. Although rare, development of GBS is a potential complication of the Influenza vaccine.""

He said the next reaction could result in the need for prednisone and could be anaphalactic or worse.

A 68-year-old female patient received pneumococcal 13-val conj vac (dipht crm197 protein) (manufacture unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2020 at single dose for immunization. Medical history included thyroid removed, bipolar, mood swings, seizures, high blood pressure, she was diagnosed with graves disease before she got the pneumonia shot, that last year (in 2019) she had the flu really bad. she had been on synthroid for maybe fifteen years. She was dying and losing twenty pounds per week.  Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) ongoing for thyroid removed, quetiapine fumarate (SEROQUEL) ongoing for bipolar and mood swings, gabapentin ongoing for seizures and atenolol, chlortalidone (ATENOLOL CHLORTHALIDONE) ongoing for high blood pressure.  She was at one time on lorazepam (ATIVAN) but she weaned herself off because it was so addictive.  Caller stated she was calling in about the pneumonia shot. She was very wary of getting the shot because she was trying to figure out if she might get sick or if it would interfere with her prescription drugs. She walked out after she got the shot, she waited five minutes, came home and couple of hours later began to hallucinate and lost vision on 04Jan2020. Caller stated she was tired and hadn't been feeling good anyway. She was jolted from her sleep when she felt like her arm was being pumped full of acid and going into her blood stream. She talked to her pharmacist to see if the pneumonia shot would interfere with her medications. Caller stated she had Graves Disease. She was diagnosed with Graves Disease before she got the pneumonia shot. She took medication. She had her thyroid removed and this is why she was such a stickler. Last year she had the flu really bad. Caller stated they checked her this year but the test was negative. Caller stated she was hallucinating when she went to bed. The hallucinations started Saturday morning and stopped after she felt the acid in her injection site. Caller stated she was not a doctor and cannot determine whether or not she had completely recovered or not. Her symptoms stopped the same day they started several hours later. On 04Jan2020, She couldn't even see and then she got double vision. Treatment: Caller stated she had to go to the walk-in clinic and the PCP after the symptoms started. The doctor at the walk-in clinic had to call the on-call doctor. He told the caller to take Benadryl. Caller stated she could feel acid going toward her heart, her pulse rate started going really fast. She got down on the floor and crawled to the kitchen. She couldn't see. Caller counted her pulse rate was out of the universe and then she said she felt a mid systolic click in her heart. Her vision started coming back but then she had double vision. On Saturday morning she couldn't make out numbers or letters. She had been on Synthroid for maybe fifteen years. She was dying and losing twenty pounds per week. She was at one time on Ativan but she weaned herself off because it is so addictive. Her doctor had to add Chlorthalidone to her Atenolol. She also wanted to say she started feeling her throat closing, she was sneezing consecutively, she had runny nose/eyes. They tested her for flu but it came back negative. The doctor there gave her a steroid shot. When she went to her PCP on Monday and got checked, they checked for the swelling in lymph nodes and that stuff. They gave her another steroid shot because of the symptoms. They recommended she go to a specialist for her eyes and she needed to have her heart hard wired.

The mother's medical history included obesity, bacterial vaginosis and she was positive for group B streptococcus.  The mother's concomitant medications included Prenatal vitamins (unspecified vitamins and minerals) as vitamin supplementation.   The mother did not have any previous pregnancies, nor maternal and paternal history with major congenital malformation (MCM). The mother did not consume tobacco, alcohol and illicit-drugs during pregnancy.  The mother's last menstrual period (LMP) date was 25-Mar-2019. The mother's estimated date of delivery (EDD) was 30-Dec-2019 and corrected estimated date of delivery (CEDD) was 06-Dec-2019. The type of pregnancy was singleton. The father  was 28-year-old. The pregnancy was complicated by bacterial vaginosis and the mother was treated with metronidazole vaginal gel, one applicator every day via vaginal route of administration.  On 05-Jun-2019, the subject's mother underwent first trimester screen and nuchal translucency and no MCM was noted.  On 02-Jul-2019, the subject's mother underwent second trimester screen and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening (MSAFP/serum markers) and no o MCM was noted.  On 11-Jul-2019, the subject underwent anatomy ultrasound and no MCM was noted.  On 16-Sep-2019, at 25 weeks of gestation, the subject's mother was administered Flucelvax QIVc [influenza vaccine, subunit influenza virus vaccine polyvalent; batch number: 261200, dose, route of administration, anatomical location and expiration date: not reported] (explicitly coded as 'Foetal exposure during pregnancy') for influenza immunisation.

At gestational age of 40.6 weeks, the mother vaginally delivered live male neonate. The neonate birth weight was 3470 grams and no data was reported for head circumference and length. Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity and respiration (APGAR) scores at one minute was 8 and at five minutes was 9. No data was reported for APGAR score at ten minutes. No MCM was identified at birth.   On an unknown date in Dec-2019, the neonate's bilirubin was 16.06 (units were not specified) and the subject was admitted to neonate intensive care unit (NICU), but further details were provided.  The reporter did not provide causality assessment to Flucelvax QIVc.  This case is linked to case 201906276 (the corresponding mother case).
